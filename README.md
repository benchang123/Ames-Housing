# Ames Housing Prices [In Progress]

## Purpose of the Analysis:

### Find out which Variables Strongly Affect the Housing Prices

The goal of this project is to determine which variables most strongly correlate to the determination of the housing prices in Ames, Iowa. After conducting EDA, multi-linear regression is conducted on the data. The loss from our chosen loss function, RMSE, will be compared to each iteration of the regression to further improve the model.

The file codebook.txt in the repository gives a description of what each independent variable is in the data.

The data of the houses was already split into the training and test dataset, so there is no need to split the training dataset in the analysis.

This project is an extension to one of the homeworks in the DATA 200 course at UC Berkeley. Some of the code of the beginning draws directly from the notebook, which will be noted in the markdown.
