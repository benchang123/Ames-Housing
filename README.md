# Ames Housing Prices [In Progress]

## Purpose of the Analysis:

### Find out which Variables Strongly Affect the Housing Prices

The goal of this project is to determine which variables most strongly correlate to the housing prices in Ames, Iowa. the part sof the notebook is split into the EDA, Feature Engineering, and Modeling where regression will be conducted. Three types of regression will be conducted (Ordinary Least Square, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression). The root means squared error will be use to determine the training error, cross validation error, and test error.

The file codebook.txt in the repository gives a description of what each independent variable is in the data.

Some of the ideas presented in this project comes from the Data 200 Course at UC Berkeley. The link to the course is here: http://www.ds100.org/su20/
